## Features
-Upload text files (.txt) via a POST request

-Process and return the file content as a JSON response

-Basic error handling and logging for troubleshooting

## Prerequisites
-Python 3.8+: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
-FastAPI: This is the main web framework for the application.

## Installation
1. Clone the Repository:
```shell
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

2. Install Dependencies:
```shell
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

3. Add Your Text File (for testing purposes): Place a .txt file in the project directory, or use the provided sample sample.txt file.

## Running the Application
Run the server with Uvicorn:
```shell
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --reload
```
The application should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8080.

## Usage
### Uploading a File via cURL
To upload a file, you can use the following curl command:
```shell
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8080/upload/" -F "file=@/path/to/sample.txt"
```

### Swagger UI
You can also test the endpoint using the Swagger UI by going to http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs. This interface provides a web form to upload a file directly.

### Example Response
If the upload is successful, the API will return a JSON response with the fileâ€™s name and content:
```shell
{
    "filename": "sample.txt",
    "content": "Sample text content for testing the upload."
}

```
